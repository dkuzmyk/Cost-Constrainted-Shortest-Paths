Project 2 by Dmytro Kuzmyk and Husna Ali

The project only has two filed: cpath.cpp and Graph.h
Graph.h will work as the original to extract the graph file.
So, make sure to have the right path for graph files in respect to source files.
Compile it with:
g++ -o cpath cpath.cpp Graph.h 
and run: 
./cpath <file.g> <source> <destination> <budget>
