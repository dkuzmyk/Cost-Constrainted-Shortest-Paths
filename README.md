# Cost-Constrainted-Shortest-Paths
Imagine the following situation. You are planning a trip across the country (from start city s to destination city d). Your degrees of freedom in selecting a particular path are captured in a graph where vertices represent locations (cities, towns, arbitrary latitude/longitude coordinates) and edges represent \links" between locations { e.g., you might be able to take a bus from vertex u to vertes v. Unlike the traditional shortest paths problem solved by, for example, Dijkstra's algorithm (where each edge (u; v) has a single weight w(u; v), each edge (u; v) in our problem has two weights: * a non-negative integer cost c and * a non-negative integer traversal time t.
